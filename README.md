# Coils.jl
Coils.jl is a set of `julia` code for designing magnetic field coils.

It uses a method of designing coils on a predefined grid.

See the `example` jupyter notebook for an introduction.

The project has been developed at [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://www.ethz.ch/) in the [Group for Precision Physics at Low Energy](http://www.edm.ethz.ch/).
